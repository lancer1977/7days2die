column 1 -> column 1
column 3 -> column 6


I have two csv files, I need to update the contents of the second file from the contents of 1.

the key is in column 1 in each file
the source contains the name I want to pull from in column 3, the destination for this value is column 6.


How can I achieve this with a bash or powershell script?
